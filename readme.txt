Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers and designers who want to beautify and streamline their Wordpress photo galleries.

== Description ==

Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers and designers who want to beautify and streamline their Wordpress photo galleries. The Photo Galleria plugin synchronizes Galleria, an elegant jQuery javascript library, with Wordpress' built-in media manager. Simply upload photos as normal and the Photo Galleria plugin will create a photo gallery with fade-in and fade-out effects common on flash-based websites. All the transitions happen inline without having to navigate to multiple Wordpress attachment pages. Pretty neat, eh?

Photo Galleria displays the thumbnail images that Wordpress creates for you and displays the original, high resolution uploaded image. Both are constrained proportionally via css. You can control their display size via the two CSS files included with the plugin. By default, the thumbnails display at 125px by 125px square and the image displays at 950px wide. Virtually every aspect of the presentation of Photo Galleria can be controlled via CSS.
