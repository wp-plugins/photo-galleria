== Description ==

Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers, designers and Wordpress 2.5 users alike who want to beautify their Wordpress photo galleries using the jquery framework. The Photo Galleria plugin synchronizes Galleria with Wordpressâ€™ built-in media manager. Simply upload photos as normal and the Photo Galleria plugin will create a photo gallery with fade-in and fade-out effects common on flash-based websites. All the transitions happen inline without having to navigate to multiple Wordpress attachment pages. Pretty neat, eh?

Photo Galleria displays the thumbnail images that Wordpress creates for you and displays the original, high resolution uploaded image. Both are constrained proportionally via css. You can control their display size via the two CSS files included with the plugin. By default, the thumbnails display at 125px by 125px square and the image displays at 950px wide. Virtually every aspect of the presentation of Photo Galleria can be controlled via CSS.
