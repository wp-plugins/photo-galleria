Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers and designers who want to beautify and streamline their Wordpress photo galleries.

== Description ==

Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers and designers who want to beautify and simplify their Wordpress photo galleries. The Photo Galleria plugin filters the default Wordpress gallery shortcode and replaces it with an elegant jQuery-powered gallery.  Simply upload photos as normal and the Photo Galleria plugin will create a photo gallery with fade-in and fade-out effects common on flash-based websites. All the transitions happen inline without having to navigate to multiple Wordpress attachment pages. This plugin comes with different design options, which you can select on the Photo Galleria Settings page.  Pretty neat, eh?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The gallery is too wide.  How do I fix that? =

Virtually every width and height variable (including large photo sizes, thumbnails and containers) can be controlled by editing the attached css files.

= What about captions? =

Yep.  If you got 'em, this plugin can display 'em.
